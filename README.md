## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

SkinSync

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows users to enter their skin type and concerns. They will be given a result of products they should use, a crafted routine, where to find those products, tips and info on using certain ingredients, etc.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be using pip as the framework.The software will prompt users to answer a series of questions about their skin, including whether they have oily, dry, or combination skin, as well as any specific concerns such as acne or sensitivity. Based on this information, the program will generate a curated list of recommended products that are tailored to their needs. Key features will include an easy-to-use questionnaire, product recommendations, extensive product descriptions, and the ability to browse user reviews. Based on the summary of the project, an ingredient matching algorithm will be implemented to recommend ingredients scientifically shown to help (such as tranexamic acid for acne scars or hyaluronic acid for dry skin). 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I will be able to have the questionnaire and results for the users because that is the main objective of the project.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think regardless, I will have the ‘ingredient matching algorithm setup because that is the second to most important part of this project. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope that I can implement a skincare API to fetch real product details, reviews and ingredients. I also hope to implement an IP address that will track the users location so they can find a nearby store to find these products.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I’m very well-educated and familiar with the aspects of skincare. I started focusing on when I was having trouble with my skin at an early age, so any research or plans on that topic is 100% clear for me and out of my way. To further complete this project, SkinSync, I will plan to build a solid foundation in web development, data processing, and a bit of machine learning for ingredient matching. I would need to research topics on how to structure a web application, how to integrate third-party APIs, and geolocations. I need to research on how to design an effective user interface to make it user-friendly. Those are all of my main focuses, tasks, and necessary skills towards the project’s completion.
